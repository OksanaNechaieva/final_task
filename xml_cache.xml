After he entered the house with Rakhi Sawant and made a public appearance on national television, his estranged wife Snigdha Priya came out and levelled some serious allegations against him. She not only claimed that Ritesh is faking to be an NRI but also accused him of domestic violence. In an explosive interview to BT she stated that Ritesh is still her husband and married to her and she was shocked to see him on Bigg Boss 15 posing as Rakhi Sawant's husband. Snigdha further shared that she had filed a case of domestic violence against him in April 2017. Now, in an exclusive interview with ETimes TV, Rakhi's husband Ritesh after getting evicted from BB 15, spoke at length about all the allegations levelled against by his wife Snigdha and in fact accussed his wife of having an affair, playing the woman card and more. He also spoke about his rude behaviour with Rakhi Sawant on national television. Ritesh claimed that if everything goes well, he will legally get married to Rakhi by 2022. </description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/exclusive-rakhi-sawants-husband-ritesh-makes-shocking-accusations-against-wife-snigdha-priya-she-tried-to-elope-twice-with-a-man-and-doesnt-let-me-meet-my-son/photostory/88407103.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/exclusive-rakhi-sawants-husband-ritesh-makes-shocking-accusations-against-wife-snigdha-priya-she-tried-to-elope-twice-with-a-man-and-doesnt-let-me-meet-my-son/photostory/88407103.cms</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 13:02:19 IST</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
